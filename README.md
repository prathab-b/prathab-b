## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Prathab

### About Me

I'm a third year student studying computer science at the University of Toronto. Some languages and tools I'm familiar with include:

- Python
- C
- Java
- Shell Scripting (SH, Bash)
- Linux

I'm currently interested in

- Creating useful projects
- Learning new technologies
- Turning ideas into code

In the future, I'm also looking to explore:

- Artificial intelligence
- Machine learning (and how human learning influences machine it)
- Web development
- Data science and databases (and large sets of data to create meaningful programs)
- Cybersecurity (and more about ethical hacking)

### Portfolio & Projects

Here are some of my projects:

#### âœ¦ Battleship
**Includes:** C, Linux
A classic server-based battleship game implemented in C that allows for multiple players to play against each other in real time, each player with their own ship and the ability to guess the location(s) of opponent ships.
